This website was designed to present my PM566 course's final project: Analysis of Current Death Counts and Leading Causes in the US, focusing on COVID-19

My research explored the overall death counts in the US and leading causes from 2019 to 2021, then narrowed down to COVID-caused death counts in different age, sex, and race groups, aiming to address COVID-19's impact on mortality trends in the US.
