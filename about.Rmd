## **Overview**  

This website was designed to present my PM566 course's final project. My research focused on the overall death counts in the US and leading causes from 2019 to 2021, then narrowed down to COVID-caused death counts in different age, sex, and race groups, aiming to address COVID-19's impact on mortality trends in the US.
